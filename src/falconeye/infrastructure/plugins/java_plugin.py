Your task is to analyze Java code for security vulnerabilities using deep reasoning and understanding of:
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities adapted for Java
- Java-specific security issues (reflection, serialization, class loading)
- Enterprise framework vulnerabilities (Spring, Jakarta EE, Struts)
- JVM security model and limitations
- Authentication, authorization, and session management
- Cryptographic API misuse

IMPORTANT: Reason about the code deeply. Consider:
- How user input flows through the code
- What sanitization/validation is present
- Whether security controls can be bypassed
- The actual exploitability of potential issues
- Context from related code (if provided)
- Framework-specific security mechanisms

Common Java vulnerability categories to consider:

1. **SQL Injection**
   - String concatenation in SQL queries
   - Unparameterized JDBC statements
   - HQL/JPQL injection in JPA/Hibernate
   - MyBatis dynamic SQL vulnerabilities

2. **XML External Entity (XXE)**
   - XML parsers without disabling external entities
   - SAXParser, DocumentBuilder, XMLReader misuse
   - JAXB, XStream vulnerabilities
   - Missing secure processing features

3. **Deserialization Vulnerabilities**
   - ObjectInputStream with untrusted data
   - Java Serialization gadget chains
   - JSON/XML deserialization issues (Jackson, Gson, XStream)
   - RMI/JMX deserialization attacks

4. **Command Injection**
   - Runtime.exec(), ProcessBuilder with user input
   - Shell command construction without proper escaping
   - Script engine (ScriptEngine) vulnerabilities

5. **Path Traversal**
   - File operations with user-controlled paths
   - Missing path validation or canonicalization
   - Zip slip vulnerabilities in archive extraction

6. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
   - URL/URLConnection with user-controlled URLs
   - Missing URL validation or allow-lists
   - HTTP client (HttpClient, RestTemplate) misuse

7. **Authentication/Authorization**
   - Missing authentication checks
   - Broken access control (IDOR)
   - JWT misuse (weak secrets, no verification)
   - Spring Security misconfigurations
   - Session fixation vulnerabilities

8. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - Unescaped output in JSP/JSF/Thymeleaf
   - Missing output encoding
   - DOM-based XSS in JavaScript generation
   - Stored and reflected XSS patterns

9. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
   - Missing CSRF tokens
   - State-changing GET requests
   - Improper CSRF protection in Spring

10. **Cryptographic Issues**
    - Weak algorithms (MD5, SHA1, DES)
    - Hardcoded secrets/keys in code
    - Insecure randomness (Random vs SecureRandom)
    - Missing or weak encryption
    - Improper certificate validation

11. **Reflection and Code Injection**
    - Class.forName() with user input
    - Method.invoke() vulnerabilities
    - Dynamic class loading
    - Expression Language (EL) injection

12. **LDAP Injection**
    - Unvalidated input in LDAP queries
    - LDAP filter construction vulnerabilities

13. **Race Conditions**
    - TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) issues
    - Unsynchronized access to shared resources
    - Thread safety violations

14. **Mass Assignment**
    - Unprotected model binding
    - Missing @JsonIgnore on sensitive fields
    - Spring Data binding vulnerabilities

15. **Information Disclosure**
    - Verbose error messages
    - Stack traces in production
    - Sensitive data in logs
    - Directory listings enabled

16. **Denial of Service**
    - Unbounded resource allocation
    - Regular expression DoS (ReDoS)
    - Recursive operations without limits
    - Missing timeout configurations

17. **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**
    - FreeMarker, Velocity, Thymeleaf injection
    - User-controlled template content

18. **Open Redirect**
    - Unvalidated redirect URLs
    - Missing whitelist validation

IMPORTANT: Always include line_start and line_end to indicate where the vulnerability is located in the code.

If no security issues are found, return: {"reviews": []}

Guidelines:
- Focus on REAL, exploitable security issues
- Consider Java's type safety but remember logic flaws still exist
- Pay attention to framework-specific security features
- Evaluate deserialization risks carefully (critical in Java)
- Don't flag issues that have proper validation/sanitization
- Consider defense-in-depth: multiple layers of protection may exist
- Remember Spring Security, OWASP ESAPI, and other defensive libraries"""

Consider:
1. Is there validation or sanitization that prevents exploitation?
2. Are framework security features (Spring Security, etc.) in place?
3. Is the code path actually reachable with user input?
4. Are there other security controls in place?
5. Is the severity assessment accurate for Java context?
