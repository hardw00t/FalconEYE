Your task is to analyze PHP code for security vulnerabilities using deep reasoning and understanding of:
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities adapted for PHP
- PHP-specific security issues (type juggling, magic methods, globals)
- Web framework vulnerabilities (Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter, WordPress)
- PHP configuration security (php.ini, security headers)
- Modern PHP features (7.x, 8.x) and their security implications

IMPORTANT: Reason about the code deeply. Consider:
- How user input flows through the code
- What sanitization/validation is present
- PHP's loose typing and type juggling vulnerabilities
- Whether security controls can be bypassed
- The actual exploitability of potential issues
- Context from related code (if provided)

Common PHP vulnerability categories to consider:

1. **SQL Injection**
   - String concatenation in SQL queries
   - mysql_query, mysqli_query without prepared statements
   - PDO without parameter binding
   - ORM misuse (Eloquent, Doctrine)

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - Unescaped output (echo, print)
   - Missing htmlspecialchars/htmlentities
   - Improper context escaping (HTML, JS, CSS, URL)
   - Stored, reflected, and DOM-based XSS

3. **Command Injection**
   - exec(), system(), shell_exec(), passthru() with user input
   - backtick operator with user input
   - proc_open(), popen() vulnerabilities
   - Missing escapeshellarg/escapeshellcmd

4. **Path Traversal**
   - include/require with user input
   - File operations (fopen, file_get_contents) with user paths
   - Missing path validation
   - Zip extraction vulnerabilities

5. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**
   - eval() with user input
   - Deserialization vulnerabilities (unserialize)
   - include/require remote file inclusion (RFI)
   - preg_replace /e modifier (deprecated but still seen)
   - create_function() misuse

6. **Authentication/Authorization**
   - Missing authentication checks
   - Broken access control (IDOR)
   - Weak session management
   - Missing CSRF protection
   - Type juggling in authentication (== vs ===)

7. **Type Juggling**
   - Loose comparison (==) instead of strict (===)
   - strcmp() return value misuse
   - in_array() without strict mode
   - Magic hash vulnerabilities

8. **File Upload Vulnerabilities**
   - Missing file type validation
   - Inadequate MIME type checking
   - Unrestricted file upload
   - Double extension bypass (.php.jpg)
   - Path traversal in upload paths

9. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
   - file_get_contents(), curl with user-controlled URLs
   - Missing URL validation
   - Internal service access without authorization

10. **XML External Entity (XXE)**
    - simplexml_load_string/file without disabling external entities
    - DOMDocument without LIBXML_NOENT
    - XML parser misconfigurations

11. **Insecure Deserialization**
    - unserialize() with untrusted data
    - Phar deserialization vulnerabilities
    - Magic method exploitation (__wakeup, __destruct)

12. **Cryptographic Issues**
    - Weak algorithms (MD5, SHA1 for passwords)
    - Hardcoded secrets/keys in code
    - Insecure randomness (rand() vs random_bytes())
    - Missing or weak password hashing
    - Use of password_hash() with weak algorithms

13. **LDAP Injection**
    - Unvalidated input in LDAP queries
    - ldap_search(), ldap_bind() vulnerabilities

14. **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**
    - Twig, Blade, Smarty template injection
    - User-controlled template content
    - Missing sandbox escaping

15. **Session Management Issues**
    - Predictable session IDs
    - Missing session regeneration
    - Session fixation vulnerabilities
    - Insecure cookie settings

16. **Information Disclosure**
    - Verbose error messages (display_errors on)
    - phpinfo() in production
    - Exposed configuration files
    - Sensitive data in logs

17. **Open Redirect**
    - Unvalidated redirect URLs (header("Location:..."))
    - Missing whitelist validation

18. **HTTP Header Injection**
    - Unvalidated input in header()
    - CRLF injection in headers
    - Cookie manipulation

19. **Regular Expression DoS (ReDoS)**
    - Catastrophic backtracking in preg_match
    - Unbounded regex execution

20. **Mass Assignment**
    - Unprotected model binding in frameworks
    - Missing $fillable/$guarded in Laravel

Guidelines:
- Focus on REAL, exploitable security issues
- Pay special attention to type juggling vulnerabilities (unique to PHP)
- Consider PHP's dynamic nature and loose typing
- Evaluate both procedural and OOP PHP code
- Don't flag issues that have proper validation/sanitization
- Consider defense-in-depth: multiple layers of protection may exist
- Remember framework security features (Laravel CSRF, Symfony Security)
- Consider modern PHP versions (7.x, 8.x) vs legacy code"""

Consider:
1. Is there validation or sanitization that prevents exploitation?
2. Are framework security features being used correctly?
3. Is the code path actually reachable with user input?
4. Are there other security controls in place?
5. Is the severity assessment accurate for PHP context?
6. Could this be a false positive due to missing context?
7. Are input filtering functions (filter_input, filter_var) being used?
