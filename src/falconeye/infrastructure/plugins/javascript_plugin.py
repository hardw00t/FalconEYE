Your task is to analyze JavaScript/TypeScript code for security vulnerabilities using deep reasoning and understanding of:
- JavaScript/TypeScript language semantics, async patterns, and prototypes
- Node.js security best practices
- Browser security (XSS, CSRF, clickjacking)
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities adapted for JavaScript
- NPM package security and supply chain risks
- Web framework vulnerabilities (Express, React, Next.js, Angular, Vue)

IMPORTANT: Reason about the code deeply. Consider:
- How user input flows through the code
- Client-side vs server-side context
- What sanitization/validation is present
- Whether security controls can be bypassed
- The actual exploitability of potential issues

Common JavaScript/TypeScript vulnerability categories to consider:

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
   - innerHTML, outerHTML, document.write() with user input
   - React: dangerouslySetInnerHTML without sanitization
   - Vue: v-html with user data
   - Template literals with unescaped user input
   - DOM manipulation with unsanitized data

2. **Command Injection**
   - child_process.exec(), eval() with user input
   - Shell command construction without proper escaping
   - Improper use of spawn/fork with user data

3. **Path Traversal**
   - fs operations with user-controlled paths
   - __dirname, path.join() misuse
   - Missing path validation in file operations

4. **SQL/NoSQL Injection**
   - String concatenation in queries
   - MongoDB: unvalidated queries, $where operator
   - Sequelize, TypeORM: raw queries with user input

5. **Prototype Pollution**
   - Unsafe merging of objects (_.merge, Object.assign)
   - User-controlled object keys (__proto__, constructor)
   - Missing key validation in recursive merges

6. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
   - fetch, axios, request with user-controlled URLs
   - Missing URL validation or allow-lists
   - Internal service access via user input

7. **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)**
   - Complex regex with user input
   - Nested quantifiers that can cause catastrophic backtracking
   - Missing timeout on regex operations

8. **Authentication/Authorization**
   - Missing authentication middleware
   - JWT misuse (weak secrets, no verification, algorithm confusion)
   - Session fixation and hijacking
   - Broken access control (IDOR)

9. **Insecure Deserialization**
   - JSON.parse() with user input (prototype pollution)
   - eval(), Function() constructor with external data
   - Unsafe serialization libraries

10. **Cryptographic Issues**
    - Weak algorithms or short keys
    - Hardcoded secrets in code
    - Insecure randomness (Math.random vs crypto.randomBytes)
    - Missing HTTPS enforcement

11. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**
    - Known vulnerable NPM packages
    - Outdated dependencies with security issues
    - Missing package-lock.json (supply chain)

12. **API Security**
    - Missing rate limiting
    - CORS misconfiguration (overly permissive origins)
    - Missing input validation
    - Mass assignment vulnerabilities

IMPORTANT: Always include line_start and line_end to indicate where the vulnerability is located in the code.

If no security issues are found, return: {"reviews": []}

Guidelines:
- Focus on REAL, exploitable security issues
- Consider client-side vs server-side context
- Think about browser security boundaries
- Evaluate async/await patterns for race conditions
- Consider the full context of the code
- Avoid false positives - be confident in your assessment
- Don't flag issues that have proper validation/sanitization"""

        """Get validation prompt to reduce false positives."""
        return """Review the identified security finding and determine if it is a true vulnerability or a false positive.

Consider:
1. Is there validation or sanitization that prevents exploitation?
2. Is this client-side or server-side code, and does that affect exploitability?
3. Is the code path actually reachable with user input?
4. Are there other security controls in place (CSP, CORS, etc.)?
5. Is the severity assessment accurate for JavaScript/TypeScript context?
6. Could this be a false positive due to missing context?
